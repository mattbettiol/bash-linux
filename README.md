bash-linux
=========

Here are some bash scripts to help you create new websites on your [linux](http://www.linux.com/) server. Each site will be assigned a user who owns the files. Some of the code may have to be modified to fit your setup.

The commands in these files are taken form [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com/) tutorials.

Make sure you [make the .sh file executable](http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/run-execute-sh-shell-script/) before you try and run it.

Once you run the script, just answer the questions that come up. That's really about it. It's pretty simple, actually.
